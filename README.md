# Urban Observatory Data Box

This a **monorepo** for setting up a system (Urban Observatory In a Box) for federated network of sensors and services. It borrows ideas from [UO Sensor Networks](https://urbanobservatory.github.io/standards/) standards and is based on implementations instrumented at [The Newcastle Urban Observatory](https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/).

---

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**⚠️

This code is work in progress and experimental.

---

## Specification

This repo presents a core infrastructure code used for setting up services for an UO, including brokerage of data from sensing devices, configuration for setting up [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), consumers for storage in [timescale](https://www.timescale.com/) database and code for exposing of APIs and socket streams.

## Authors

uo-in-abox has been originally developed by:

- Luke Smith (Newcastle University)

Contributors:

- Aare Puussaar (Newcastle University)

## Deployment

For deployment and usage see [uo-data-skeleton](https://github.com/urbanobservatory/uo-data-skeleton)

## Development

> **NOTE!** Applications often need other services (e.g. `rabbitmq` or `timescaledb`) to be already running and waiting for connections. Some apps also need extra configuration parameters to run in addition to `default config` in the code.

### Without docker

```bash
# setup
npm i # install dependencies

# to run apps
npm run start:{app} [cli options] # e.g. -- --verbose [--configuration=${UO_BROKER_CONFIGURATION}]
```

### With docker

Code is mapped as volumes on docker containers so it is possible to run apps locally using special configuration and [uo-data-skeleton](https://github.com/urbanobservatory/uo-data-skeleton) scripts. Dependencies need to be installed in docker image if `package.json` is changed (initialise code rebuild by using `--build`).

## Code Structure

### `src/shared`

Code shared across all the implementations such as `types`, `ORM` database models.

- ### `src/shared/services`

  Services shared across all applications and broker services. `receiver` does the bulk of the injector script. Also has broker specific services and utility services such as `log`.

- ### `src/shared/brokers`

  Deals with getting data from sensors, APIs and HTTP uploads, and pushes it to queues. Also links to `controllers` and gives it _platform_ and _unity_ names. This is what you would extend if you would want to add a special type of broker handling data from a incoming feed.

### `src/apps`

Configuration and setup for apps for the `uo-instance` for `queue`, `database`, `brokers` and `web` services.

- ### `src/apps/master`

  Contains config for `rabbitMQ` queue server and `timescaledb` database setup, and node injector scripts for consuming the queue.

- ### `src/apps/broker`

  Configurations for broker services and feeds to listen to for data. This is what you would use if you want to add a new broker feed to listen to. Uses `docker-compose` file initiated from [uo-data-skeleton](https://github.com/urbanobservatory/uo-data-skeleton) to build application using by `src/shared/brokers` controller implementations.

- ### `src/apps/web`

  Web Services.

  - ### `src/apps/web/api`

    API codebase to make public REST APIs.

  - ### `src/apps/web/stream`

    Socket stream codebase.

  - ### `src/apps/web/docs`

    OpenAPI documentation generator.

### `src/scripts`

Utility scripts.

## Additional Resources

### `archive`

Folder for uploaded images/files that are served via web `file service`. For example uploaded/downloaded images in `./public`.

### `cache`

Cache folder for `.json` files. For example from classification.

### `docs`

Location of OpenAPI docs generated files.

## Future Ideas

- add configurable schema version to database container
- add generic broker configurations
- make APIDocs configurable
- document logging options
- add auto lint and prettier configurations
