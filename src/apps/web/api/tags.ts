    description:
      'There may be more than one timeseries associated with a sensor, provided for convenience. Ordinarily there will be a plain timeseries, representing raw data from the device. In some cases, there may then be additional timeseries representing converted values (e.g. scaled), corrected, or aggregated temporally.',
