# Broker

This folder consists of example brokers that are specific for [Urban Observatory](https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/) at Newcastle. That said, some information might have been retracted or needed to use these particular broker setups. These are just provided as examples to build upon.

> **NOTE!** when moving over to [uo-standards](https://urbanobservatory.stoplight.io/) ontology, some of the broker configurations might have been affected and naming convention may not be consistent across the codebase.

## More generic examples coming soon...
